# alphavantage-test-automation
## Introduction
This Test Automation Framework is created using `Cypress` and JavaScript. 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter' was used as the reporting plugin and `@cypress/grep` was introduced to filter and execute tests easily

## How to setup the Project
1. Clone the project from Github
2. Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. You are all set! Happy testing! ðŸŽ‰

## How to run the Tests Locally
- To open the cypress window -> `npx cypress open`
- To run all the tests using console -> `npx cypress run`

### Additional Configurations
- This project supports test execution across multiple environments (e.g., dev, stage).
- To add a new environment, create an `env.json` file in the `cypress/environments` directory and include the necessary environment variables.
- To execute tests in a specific environment, use the Cypress commands with the `envFile` variable to specify your desired environment.
```
npx cypress open --env envFile=stage
npx cypress run --env envFile=dev
```
- Also users have the ability to override any env variable using the terminal
```
npx cypress run --env envFile=stage,apikey="demo"
```
- When executing tests you can utilize the [@cypress/grep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/grep) library to efficiently filter the test cases. This library offers various filtering options to tailor test execution according to your needs. For detailed usage and combinations, please refer to the library documentation.
```
npx cypress run --env envFile=stage,grepTags="@smoke"
npx cypress run --env envFile=stage,grep="Test-1.6"
```
## How to run the Tests in CI
- `cypress_tests.yml` file is implemented as a manual trigger. Users are able to execute this workflow in Github Actions providing the required information
  - Branch - Required branch to execute the tests from (default is `main`)
  - Test type - Required test tags to execute (default is set as `@smoke`)
  - Environment - Required environment to execute the tests (default is set as `stage`)

## Test Reporting
 - 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter' is configured for reporting. When the tests executed via cypress run command it will create a detailed test report in `cypress/reports` directory
 - When it comes to the CI executions, the report is uploaded as an artifact in the specific build. To access the report download the `cypress-results` artifact and extract.

## Static Code Analysis
- ESLint is configured for static code analysis of Cypress tests. This setup ensures that any commits to the main branch trigger an automatic linting process.

## Note
- Please Note that from one alphavantage API_KEY it allows only 25 requests per day. So if we trigger the tests multiple times there can be some issues. 
- To avoid this we could create a API key dynamically before each test run. This was not implemented at the moment since there is also a limit using the same IP
